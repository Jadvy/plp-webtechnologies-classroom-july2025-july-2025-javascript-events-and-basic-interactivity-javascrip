# Week 6 Assignment — Interactive Web Page

This starter matches the Week 6 deliverables:

## Files
- **index.html** — structured page with:
  - A form (name, email, password)
  - Interactive counter section
  - Theme toggler
- **style.css** — optional styles for clarity
- **script.js** — covers:
  - Event handling for buttons and form
  - At least 2 interactive features (counter, theme toggler)
  - Custom form validation (no HTML5-only validation)

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the counter and theme toggler for interactivity.
3. Test the form with valid/invalid inputs to see validation.

## Suggested initial commit
`Initial commit: Add Week 6 interactive page (index.html, style.css, script.js)`
